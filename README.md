## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your Pyscrapy environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

* **Conda** (Anaconda or Miniconda) installed on your system.
* A stable internet connection.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    If this project is hosted on GitHub or similar, you'd start by cloning it:
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd Pyscrapy
    ```
    (Otherwise, just ensure you are in the `Pyscrapy` project directory).

2.  **Create a Conda Environment:**
    We recommend using Python 3.13, which is available via the `conda-forge` channel.
    ```bash
    conda create -n pyscrapy python=3.13 -c conda-forge
    ```
    When prompted, type `y` and press Enter to proceed.

3.  **Activate the Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate pyscrapy
    ```
    Your terminal prompt should now show `(pyscrapy)`.

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    All required Python packages are listed in `requirement.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):**
    If your project uses sensitive information (like API keys), it likely reads them from an `.env` file. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project:
    ```
    # .env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    # Add any other environment variables your project needs
    ```
    **Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`** with your actual Gemini API key. Make sure to **never commit this file to version control** (it's typically ignored by `.gitignore`).

## üèÉ Usage

Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run your Pyscrapy project.

### Running Scrapy Spiders

[**Provide instructions on how to run your Scrapy spiders.**]

Example (replace `your_spider_name` with the actual name of your spider):
```bash
scrapy crawl your_spider_name


#To output data to a file (e.g., JSON):
scrapy crawl your_spider_name -o output.json
python test.py
